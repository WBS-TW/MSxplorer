\arguments{
\item{filepath}{string. Path to mzML/mzXML file}

\item{featlist}{data.frame. Variable names should be: name, mz, ms_level (has to be either "ms1, "ms2)}

\item{numTopIons}{num number of most intensive MS2 ions to extract}

\item{diff}{num range of mass (Da) to extract from the mz specified in featlist (mz-diff, mz+diff)}

\item{mserr}{num mass error (Da) of the range boundaries specified in diff (mz-diff+-mserr, mz+dif+-mserr)}

\item{rtWindow}{num the retention time range to extract MS2 EIC (in sec). Error occurs if set too low.}

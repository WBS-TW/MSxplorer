- Change: use a shiny interface and select input file
- ADD: argument to state whether input rt is in minutes or seconds, since

- Add another button to send selected fragments to Metfrag OR copy the fragments in format to directly copy to Metfrag.
- Find way to extract MS1 peaks in spectrum and calculate Pearson correlation or cosine score with MS2 diagnostic ions within a selected time window. 
- Add average MS1 and MS2 spectra of selected rt range
- Add textOutput to display the calculated mz diff and error?
- Add a checkbox/inputmenu option to do smoothing
- Add function to omit deselected m/z trace. Then another press on Get MS1 would find new highest ions without these delected m/z.

- Whenever a trace (EIC) is deleted then another one appear as replacement -> iterative selection -> low abundance ions can be visible to correlate with chosen ions.


CHECK
- Theoretical formulas for 98.9552,(FSO3) and 79.9558 (SO3). Use: https://www.chemcalc.org/mf-finder. Range: C0-10 H0-20 N0-2 O0-5 Si0-3 F0-6 S0-2


//ExportMSP//
- Change to input file; excel or csv with variables (MS DIAL format): Num, RT (min)
- Update the calculation based on the input number of carbons


//Geomviolin plot//
Add a new function to plot the geomviolin plot of xcmsExp object

ADDED 20210727: Add a selection to choose which column to be "intensity". Can be beneficial for isotope plot since not all samples have the isotopes.
FIXED: Only top "n"" hits will be shown.
FIXED: Sync the two plots at x-axis (same retention time scale during zooming). Put sync buttons on left panel to sync either first or second plots.
FIXED: Add selection to choose round, ceiling, floor
